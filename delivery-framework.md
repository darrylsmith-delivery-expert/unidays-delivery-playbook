# Agile Delivery Framework

## Overview
My delivery approach combines the structure of Scrum with the flow-based flexibility of Kanban to create a balanced, outcome-focused framework. The goal is to maximise value delivery while maintaining predictability, transparency, and continuous learning.

## Core Principles
- **Outcome over output:** Teams focus on measurable business value rather than just completing work.
- **Iterative learning:** Each sprint, cycle, or increment is a learning opportunity that shapes future planning.
- **Transparency:** Progress, blockers, and risks are visible to all stakeholders.
- **Sustainable pace:** Delivery is managed to avoid burnout and ensure consistent momentum.

## Key Components
| Area | Practice | Benefit |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Planning | Sprint or cycle planning anchored on business goals | Ensures alignment and shared understanding |
| Flow | WIP limits, visualised workflow | Improves throughput and early detection of bottlenecks |
| Delivery | Incremental, testable releases | Builds trust and validates assumptions faster |
| Feedback | Reviews, retrospectives, metrics dashboards | Drives adaptation and data-led improvement |
| Continuous Improvement | Regular experimentation with tools and process | Encourages ownership and innovation |

## Leadership Style
- Empower teams to make delivery decisions close to the work.
- Use facilitation to create clarity and resolve conflicts early.
- Build strong relationships between engineering, product, and design functions.
