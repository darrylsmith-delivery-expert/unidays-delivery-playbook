# Agile Health and Team Maturity

> Example of how I measure and grow team health, maturity, and engagement.

## Objective
Healthy, empowered teams deliver better outcomes. I use lightweight health checks and maturity models to help teams reflect and identify their next focus area for improvement.

## Method
- **6 monthly Team Health Survey:** Westrum Surveys utilising simple 1–5 scale across areas like collaboration, clarity, pace, and happiness.
- **Facilitated Review:** Teams discuss results openly, identifying key themes and next steps.  Stakeholders encouraged to engage, and enigeers from other teams with oermission from their leads.
- **Iterative Tracking:** Compare results over time to celebrate progress and identify persistent challenges.  Monthly reports to trace and compare key metrics.

## Example Health Dimensions
| Dimension | Focus | Typical Actions |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Collaboration | Communication & trust | Pair programming, shared planning sessions |
| Delivery Flow | Work-in-progress limits, dependencies | Simplify handoffs, refine backlog |
| Learning | Continuous improvement & experimentation | Learning days, innovation spikes |
| Sustainability | Workload balance & morale | Capacity planning, wellbeing checks |

## Outcomes
- Increased cross-team collaboration and reduced blockers.
- Early identification of morale dips before impacting delivery.
- Greater team autonomy and ownership of improvement actions.
