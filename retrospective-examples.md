# Retrospective Examples

## Purpose
Retrospectives create structured space for continuous improvement — they allow teams to identify what’s working, what’s not, and what to change next.

## Typical Format
1. **Set the Stage:** Create psychological safety and clarify the goal.
2. **Gather Data:** Review metrics, delivery flow, and qualitative feedback.
3. **Generate Insights:** Look for patterns in blockers or dependencies.
4. **Decide Actions:** Select 1–2 practical improvements.
5. **Close Positively:** Recognise successes and individuals.

## Example Retrospective Techniques
- **Start / Stop / Continue**
- **Mad / Sad / Glad**
- **Sailboat Exercise**
- **4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)**

## Sample Outcomes
- Reduced unplanned work by introducing clearer sprint goals.
- Improved QA turnaround through earlier collaboration.
- Increased team morale via visible celebration of wins.

> The most effective retrospectives end with one small, meaningful change — not a long wish list.
