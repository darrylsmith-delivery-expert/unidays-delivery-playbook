# DORA Metrics and Continuous Improvement

## Why Metrics Matter
DORA metrics provide a clear, data-driven view of engineering performance. By measuring these consistently, teams can move from anecdotal discussions about “speed” to meaningful, actionable insights.

## Core Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency** – How often the team delivers value to production.
- **Lead Time for Changes** – How quickly a commit goes from code to production.
- **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)** – How fast the team can recover from an incident.
- **Change Failure Rate** – The percentage of changes that result in issues.

## Approach
1. **Baseline and Visibility:** Collect historical data and visualise trends using dashboards.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** Review data with engineers, QA, and product to interpret signals.
3. **Set Targets and Hypotheses:** Identify one small improvement per quarter to focus on.
4. **Iterate and Reflect:** Track results in retrospectives; celebrate both learning and improvement.

## Example Outcomes
- Improved **deployment frequency** from 2 production releases per month to multiple deployments per day through CI/CD optimisations.
- Reduced **lead time** by refining ticket workflow and review policies.
- Enhanced **cross-team trust** via open dashboards and demo-driven reviews.

> Metrics are a mirror for conversation, not a scorecard for blame.
