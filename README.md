# Agile Delivery Portfolio – Darryl Smith

### Senior Agile Delivery Manager | Engineering Delivery Leadership | DORA Metrics | Continuous Improvement

This portfolio showcases my approach to agile delivery leadership, developed over several years of experience guiding cross-functional software teams, and leading agile experts within fast-paced digital organisations.

Following a successful five-year tenure as Head of Core Engineering and Head of Agile at Tempcover, I took a planned career break to recharge and refocus on my long-term goal — applying my delivery leadership experience within a forward-thinking, purpose-driven technology organisation such as UNiDAYS.

## 🔍 Overview

My delivery philosophy centres around:
- **Predictable, high-quality delivery** through data-driven iteration
- **Empowered teams** that take ownership of outcomes, not just output
- **Collaborative improvement** using frameworks like Scrum, Kanban and Shape Up
- **Transparent metrics** that drive trust and progress across teams
