# Agile Delivery Portfolio – Darryl Smith

### Senior Agile Delivery Manager | Engineering Delivery Leadership | DORA Metrics | Continuous Improvement

## Why UNiDAYS

UNiDAYS’ mission to empower and connect the next generation resonates strongly with my own approach to delivery leadership — one grounded in purpose, learning, and measurable impact. I’m inspired by how the Product & Engineering organisation builds meaningful, high-quality digital experiences that evolve with user needs.  

As an Agile Delivery Manager, I’m motivated by opportunities to help teams achieve consistency and confidence in delivery, especially where rapid iteration and cross-functional collaboration are key to success. I believe great delivery is about more than just process — it’s about creating the conditions for teams to thrive, learn quickly, and take pride in what they ship.

## 🔍 Overview

My delivery philosophy centres around:
- **Predictable, high-quality delivery** through data-driven iteration
- **Empowered teams** that take ownership of outcomes, not just output
- **Collaborative improvement** using frameworks like Scrum, Kanban and Shape Up
- **Transparent metrics** that drive trust and progress across teams
