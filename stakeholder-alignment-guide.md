# Stakeholder Alignment Guide
> My approach to building clarity and trust across engineering and product teams.

## Philosophy
Clear communication and shared understanding are the foundation of reliable delivery. As a Delivery Manager, my role is to create alignment between product, engineering, and business stakeholders while maintaining flow for the delivery team.

## Core Practices
### 1. Regular Delivery Syncs
Short, focused sessions with product and engineering leads to surface risks early and agree on trade-offs.

### 2. Clear Progress Reporting
Use visual dashboards and concise delivery summaries to provide transparency and context, not just metrics.

### 3. Decision Logs
Document key delivery decisions in lightweight logs. This builds accountability and reduces rework caused by unclear direction.

### 4. Escalation Management
Proactively highlight delivery risks and propose solutions; never escalate without an option or recommendation.

### 5. Outcome Review
At the end of each delivery cycle, reflect on whether outcomes met expectations and what adjustments are needed.

> Alignment is not achieved through meetings — it’s sustained through clarity, visibility, and trust.
